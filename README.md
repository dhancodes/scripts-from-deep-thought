# Ahoy!

Syntax and clauses and structures on Cython
Dark themed consoles and adorn bytes written
Well written packages decked up with strings
These are few of my favorite things
Green coloured prompts and lisp hash tables
Bourne shells and Z shell and piping to term
Wild bugs that sly with bool on their whiles
These are few of my favorite things.
